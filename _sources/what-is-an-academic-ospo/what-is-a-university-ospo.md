# What is a university OSPO?


The [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/resources/glossary/) defines an OSPO as:

‘ … the center of competency for an organization's open source operations and structure. It is responsible for defining and implementing strategies and policies to guide these efforts. This can include setting policies around code use, distribution, selection, auditing, contributing, and other key areas …’ (More information [here)](https://ospoglossary.todogroup.org/ospo-definition/).

To summarize, OSPOs are an organizational construct that acts as a convener, community steward, and center of competency for open source software.

OSPOs also need to account for the specific mission and cultural context of the environment they operate in.

According to the [Guide to setting up a University Open Source Program Office](https://ospoplusplus.org/resource/guide-to-set-up-a-university-open-source-programs-office/), the overarching goal of a university OSPO is to maximize the social and economic impact of open source software for research, education, translation (i.e. impact of research and education beyond the university), and community engagement.
