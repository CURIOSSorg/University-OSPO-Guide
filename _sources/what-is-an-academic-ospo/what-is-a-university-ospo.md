# The growing importance of open source in the university context

Open source software is becoming increasingly important in the university context.

Not only, is open source software a research tool, it also represents one of three primary research outputs alongside articles and data.

Open source software is a vital component for fostering reproducibility and addressing security concerns in research.

Moreover, researchers tend to be more willing to ask for assistance with software management rather than article or data management. Therefore, opportunities for engagement around open source exist in perhaps unique ways.
