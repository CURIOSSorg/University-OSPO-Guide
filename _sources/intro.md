# Welcome to the CURIOSS Guide to setting up a University Open Source Program Office (OSPO).

[CURIOSS](https://curioss.org/) is a <b>C</b>ommunity for those working in <b>U</b>niversity and <b>R</b>esearch <b>I</b>nstitution <b>OSPOs</b>.

The primary purpose of this guide is to provide a living toolkit that shares best practice and case studies for staff in universities and research institutions who are in the process of setting up an OSPO.

#### Using and contributing to this Guide
This handbook is not designed to be read from start to finish. Use our search box or dip into the different sections of this toolkit for information that will assist you in your current work.

Our toolkit is broadly organized into different stages of engagement for individuals or institutions seeking to establish an OSPO:

- <b>What is an academic OSPO?</b> - This section provides background context and provides the fundamental question to be answered for both you and your institution.

- <b>Getting started</b> - This section is for individuals who are at the very beginning of their OSPO journey.

- <b>Engaging with stakeholders and decision makers</b> - This section focuses on communicating, engaging and securing support from leadership and key stakeholders in your institution.

- <b>Focused OSPOs</b> - This section is for OSPOs with a very specific project/goal in mind.

- <b>Comprehensive OSPOs</b> - This is for anyone looking to develop a wide-reaching comprehensive OSPO that serves many cohorts within their academic community.

- <b>Resources</b> - More information about resources available.

These stages are not linear, sequential, or hierarchical.

Every institution will adopt different strategies or activities, depending on the level of open source related research, education, student engagement, and interest in translation or dissemination beyond their institution.
