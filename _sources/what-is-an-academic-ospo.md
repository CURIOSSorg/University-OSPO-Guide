# What is an academic OSPO?

## The growing importance of open source in the university context

Open source software is becoming increasingly important in the university context.

Not only, is open source software a research tool, it also represents one of three primary research outputs alongside articles and data.

Open source software is a vital component for fostering reproducibility and addressing security concerns in research.

Moreover, researchers tend to be more willing to ask for assistance with software management rather than article or data management. Therefore, opportunities for engagement around open source exist in perhaps unique ways.

## What is a university OSPO?


The [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/resources/glossary/) defines an OSPO as:

‘ … the center of competency for an organization's open source operations and structure. It is responsible for defining and implementing strategies and policies to guide these efforts. This can include setting policies around code use, distribution, selection, auditing, contributing, and other key areas …’ (More information [here)](https://ospoglossary.todogroup.org/ospo-definition/).

To summarize, OSPOs are an organizational construct that acts as a convener, community steward, and center of competency for open source software.

OSPOs also need to account for the specific mission and cultural context of the environment they operate in.

According to the [Guide to setting up a University Open Source Program Office](https://ospoplusplus.org/resource/guide-to-set-up-a-university-open-source-programs-office/), the overarching goal of a university OSPO is to maximize the social and economic impact of open source software for research, education, translation (i.e. impact of research and education beyond the university), and community engagement.
